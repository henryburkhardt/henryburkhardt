### Welcome!

I'm Henry, a computer science student in Minneapolis, MN. My interests lie in machine learning, simulations and data science.

This GitHub is a space for my most recent hobby projects. All code is my own work. I'm currently working in the Machine Learning space- implementing neural networks in two of my projects: delayed-flights and avocado-economics.
