### Welcome!

This GitHub is a space for my most recent hobby projects and explorations. All code is my own work. I'm currently getting started in the Machine Learning space- implementing neural networks in two of my projects: [delayed-flights](https://github.com/henryburkhardt/delayed-flights) and [avocado-economics](https://github.com/henryburkhardt/avocado-economics).
